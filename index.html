                    <p>A quick introduction into what i do. I studied both management and marketing at the University of Otago, finishing up in October 2014. I am part of Enspiral Dev Academy's 'Kakapo' Cohort currently working through phase-0, where we learn all about the command line, git/github, and plenty of other interesting things</p>

                    <p>This is my first website i have EVER worked on, therefore my code, design, and actual implementation of this site is shotty. What this means is that i have a project to work on! YAY. At least i got this thing semi-working using the parallax scroll (I don't even know how to structure a HTML page yet, google has been my best friend recently). I can say that i wrote alot of the code needed for this which I am proud of</p>

                    <p>To do:

                        <li>Learn to code properly first before bashing around!</li>
                        <li>Create a footer for social accounts</li>
                        <li>Learn to structure code properly</li>
                        <li>Read over course notes again and correct any mistakes</li>
                        <li>Practice git pull/push/commit - often</li>

                      </p>

                      <p>I'm excited to learn more about different languages and see how they interact with one another. This is my final task for Unit-1/Week-1 pretty much, hence why i have played around with this.</p>


                    <p>Bye for now, Geordi</p>
