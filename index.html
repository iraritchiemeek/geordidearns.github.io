                    <p>Version control (such as Git) is a system that allows users to track changes made to files, or file sets, with the purpose of allowing the revision of these changes through-out time and have the ability to see the progression of versions created. To put it in context, imagine a world where a builder finished a house and didn't like the bathroom because it wasn't himself that built it. He could return the building to it's original state, and modify it how he wanted it, or just see the changes being made through-out the construction process. That is essentially what version control allows.</p>

                  <p>Git uses the two-way SHA-1 encryption algorithm created by the national security association to save the content. It's two-way because it allows content to be re-produced once saved. Using a local repository (a place where files and folders are kept) on your computer, you are able to 'commit' (or save) changes made to a file, which then saves on your computer. These files then can be 'pushed' (or saved) on github. Github is an online storage application for these repositories allows the files to be managed and re-produced when needed.</p>

                  <p>Github, as described before, is online storage for development repositorys, which holds huge benefits for those that use it. Some of these include:

                        <li>Easy contribution to open-source projects: Because the repositories are remote, and can be accessed from anywhere in the world with an internet connection, the ability to effectively collaborate on projects becomes a much smaller hurdle for teams looking to work together within companies, and across countries.</li>

                        <li>Documentation: Github has extensive support for those who wish to use the service. From guides, to articles, to sample, they cover many issues that programmers face within their development environment.</li>

                        <li>Github pages: this makes it possible to create and host static websites, which allows users to gain a web-presence from the out-set, before shifting it onto a separate server.</li>

                  <p> When i heard about Dev Academy, i was in wellington taking part in the start-up weekend hosted by massey university. I was a marketer, with a passion for business strategy. I had always felt i wanted something more. Not in the greedy 'smash-and-grab' sense, rather, i wanted to really contribute to something that provided people with value. No disrespect to business, it's still a huge interest of mine, but i wanted to show my creative side and knew i had to change careers to fully have the chance to do so.</p>

                  <p>When i spoke to Joshua Vial about applying for the academy, i immediately knew it was going to happen. How he described the learning style, as opposed to the traditional class-room enticed me to look further into it. I searched online, and found some great blogs that talked about Dev Bootcamp graduates and their experiences through-out their time on-site. I always struggled witht he 'sit-and-read' style of learning, and my graduation from the University of Otago couldn't come any sooner. The description of a classroom involving emotional intelligence and mindfulness whilst learning to program ultimately pushed me over edge to up and leave my home of dunedin and create a new path for myself.</p>

                  <p>My expectations of Dev Academy have changed. At first i thought it was going to be a very individualistic environment, while still learning about the value of teamwork and empathy, but now i realise it is all an 'all-in' experience to make yourself a better person while learning to program. I'm nervous in the sense that i'm moving from a traditional form of education into this new form. but one thing is for sure.... i cannot wait to get stuck in!</p>
