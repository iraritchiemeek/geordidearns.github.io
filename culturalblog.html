                  <p>When researching my personal thinking style again, I believe I am a mix between ‘concrete random thinker’, and ‘abstract random thinker’. I like to experiment and try things with the code, to see their outcomes. I also learn through reflection a lot more than a structured linear fashion. Working with people gives me motivation to partake and get involved in comparison to sitting solo and working through challenges presented. I think the people-orientated aspect of my thinking style will play a major role in my learning process while at EDA, since majority of the work will be done through pairing.

                  This last week of learning ruby has been the biggest struggle for myself, as it is forcing me to think differently, from a less unstructured creative mind, into a more systematic approach when attempting to solve problems. The internalization of information is also hard, although I am slowly beginning to pick the syntax up, and applying it where needed.

                  <p> When i heard about Dev Academy, i was in wellington taking part in the start-up weekend hosted by massey university. I was a marketer, with a passion for business strategy. I had always felt i wanted something more. Not in the greedy 'smash-and-grab' sense, rather, i wanted to really contribute to something that provided people with value. No disrespect to business, it's still a huge interest of mine, but i wanted to show my creative side and knew i had to change careers to fully have the chance to do so.</p>

                  <p>When i spoke to Joshua Vial about applying for the academy, i immediately knew it was going to happen. How he described the learning style, as opposed to the traditional class-room enticed me to look further into it. I searched online, and found some great blogs that talked about Dev Bootcamp graduates and their experiences through-out their time on-site. I always struggled witht he 'sit-and-read' style of learning, and my graduation from the University of Otago couldn't come any sooner. The description of a classroom involving emotional intelligence and mindfulness whilst learning to program ultimately pushed me over edge to up and leave my home of dunedin and create a new path for myself.</p>

                  <p>My expectations of Dev Academy have changed. At first i thought it was going to be a very individualistic environment, while still learning about the value of teamwork and empathy, but now i realise it is all an 'all-in' experience to make yourself a better person while learning to program. I'm nervous in the sense that i'm moving from a traditional form of education into this new form. but one thing is for sure.... i cannot wait to get stuck in!</p>
