                    <p>Version control (such as Git) is a system that allows users to track changes made to files, or file sets, with the purpose of allowing the revision of these changes through-out time and have the ability to see the progression of versions created. To put it in context, imagine a world where a builder finished a house and didn't like the bathroom because it wasn't himself that built it. He could return the building to it's original state, and modify it how he wanted it, or just see the changes being made through-out the construction process. That is essentially what version control allows.</p>

                  <p>Git uses the two-way SHA-1 encryption algorithm created by the national security association to save the content. It's two-way because it allows content to be re-produced once saved. Using a local repository (a place where files and folders are kept) on your computer, you are able to 'commit' (or save) changes made to a file, which then saves on your computer. These files then can be 'pushed' (or saved) on github. Github is an online storage application for these repositories allows the files to be managed and re-produced when needed.</p>

                  <p>Github, as described before, is online storage for development repositorys, which holds huge benefits for those that use it. Some of these include:

                        <li>Easy contribution to open-source projects: Because the repositories are remote, and can be accessed from anywhere in the world with an internet connection, the ability to effectively collaborate on projects becomes a much smaller hurdle for teams looking to work together within companies, and across countries.</li>

                        <li>Documentation: Github has extensive support for those who wish to use the service. From guides, to articles, to sample, they cover many issues that programmers face within their development environment.</li>

                        <li>Github pages: this makes it possible to create and host static websites, which allows users to gain a web-presence from the out-set, before shifting it onto a separate server.</li>
